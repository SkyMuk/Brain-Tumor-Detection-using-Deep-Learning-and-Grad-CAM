# 🧠 Brain Tumor Detection with Deep Learning and Grad-CAM

This project presents an **end-to-end machine learning pipeline** for detecting brain tumors in MRI scans using deep learning. It combines a **CNN with a pretrained Xception backbone** for image classification, integrates **Grad-CAM** to visualize what the model "sees", and is deployed via a **Streamlit app** for real-time clinical use.

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Early and accurate diagnosis of brain tumors is critical for effective treatment planning and improving patient outcomes. Manual MRI interpretation is time-consuming and subject to human error. This project addresses that challenge by building an **AI-assisted system** that can automatically classify brain MRI scans and highlight regions of concern.
