# ðŸ§  Brain Tumor Detection with Deep Learning (Accuracy: 99%)

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify brain MRI images into multiple categories using transfer learning with Xception. It demonstrates the use of Grad-CAM for explainability and a Streamlit app for deployment.

## Features
- Xception-based CNN model
- Achieves 99% training accuracy
- Grad-CAM visualization to explain predictions
- Streamlit web app for real-time MRI image classification

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the app:
```
streamlit run app.py
```
